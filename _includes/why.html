									<h4>Higher Code Quality</h4>
									<p>Pushing code to place that is visible to the public should inspire Engineers to write higher quality, better tested, and better documented code.</p>

									<h4>Increased Code Modularity</h4>
									<p>Creating isolated standalone projects means that our code will naturally be better decoupled. This is especially beneficial as we transition into a service-oriented world.</p>

									<h4>Exposure</h4>
									<p>Any company or individual can throw up a public repo and brag about how theyâ€™re committed to OSS. However, if we maintain a credible standard, this can still be a great opportunity for us to show off our hard work as an engineering team. Making quality work public gives us a good chance of attracting other like-minded talent with a similar appreciation for quality.</p>

									<h4>Good Karma</h4>
									<p>There are many open source libraries and tools that we use at Meetup to help us accomplish our mission. Given the opportunity, we should try to give something of quality back to the community where it might help others accomplish their missions.</p>
